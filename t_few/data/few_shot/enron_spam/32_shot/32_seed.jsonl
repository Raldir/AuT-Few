one ( 31 ) people have been killed . heads of government from the west , especially british and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe \u0092 s plan . subsequently the south africa government community ( s . a . d . c ) has continuously supported mugabe \u0092 s new land reform act .\nit is against this background that i and my family who are currently staying in south africa as an asylum seeker refuges have decided to transfer this money into a foreign accounts and me being the eldest son of my father and who he deposited the consignment ( money ) in my name , i am saddled with the responsibilities of seeking your assistance to come to south africa due to the need involve a foreigner , foreign account and foreign beneficiary because my status here in south africa as a refugee / asylum seeker i do not allowed to operate in any banking system or business within south africa and with my status i cannot do anything except consulting a capable foreigner like you because the south africa foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment since my family and i are staying here as an\nasylum seekers refugee and i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount in south africa for fear of seizure and encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same history and i need a genuine foreign account where this money will be transferred without the knowledge of government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and the south africa government seem to be playing along with them .\nthis is why the success and smooth transfer of this money must involve a foreign partner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary whom will stand as my foreign partner as i will present you as the foreign partner ownership of the consignment also forwards to you all the necessary documents of deposited , because all the original documents which my late father used when depositing this money , all are with me . more so i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free , it ' s why my family and i , have agreed that on the conclusion of this transaction , immediately this money is out from the\nsecurity company on your arrival here in south africa to your nominated bank account there in your country . you will be taken immediately 30 % of the total amount of money for your good help and assistance , while 5 % will be out for any expenses that accorded during the process of this transaction , then 65 % will be for me and my family for our investments there in your country\nfinally , please call me urgently as soon as you receive my letter through my phone umber : + 27 -
