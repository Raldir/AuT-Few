( i will be glad to put\nthis additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move\nforward . )\ni felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our\napproach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you\nmight need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you\nwere able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same\ntime its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the\nbenefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a\ncomplement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i\nwould be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i\nlook forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as\na very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to\nearn and secure your business .\nif you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount\nmarketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you\nbegin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1\nday training seminar .\nour clients are usually very fluent after that 1\nday training seminar .\nthereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a\nfew weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable\nbefore you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks\nlater .\nthanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that\ni might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show\nanything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the\nmeeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .\ndale nesbitt\npresident\nmarketpoint inc .\n27121 adonna ct .\nlos altos hills , ca 94022\n( 650 ) 218 - 3069\ndale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com\n- license . doc", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}
