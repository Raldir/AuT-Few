{"text": "california energy crisis. california energy crisis california \u0001 , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several\nmonths . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .\nplease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation\nand our position on california energy issues .\nwhat happened in california\nthe source of california \u0001 , s current problem is as straightforward as supply\nand demand . california \u0001 , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,\npredictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10\npercent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related\nfactors that led to the current crisis . first , the state \u0001 , s regulations\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for\npower is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long\nterm , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in\ncalifornia , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine\nwhile the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained\nin effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep\ncompetition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the\nregulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\nin short , california \u0001 , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .\nregulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new\ngeneration from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile\nspot prices .\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned\nthe state \u0001 , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,\nif adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\nenron \u0001 , s role\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix\nthe problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the\npoliticians and the media . here are the facts :\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the\nstate of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the\nsame market available to other california purchasers . because we are a\nmarket maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package products\nfor our customers .\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from\nthe problems the states \u0001 , utilities , and their customers , now face . we\nprotected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply\npower directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on\nthe open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \u0001 enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western\npower markets . enron \u0001 , s primary business is managing risk for our customers\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more\ndemand for our products and services .\nthe solution\nthe solution to california \u0001 , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the\nstate must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market\nand shore up the financial stability of the state \u0001 , s utilities .\nincreasing supply\ncalifornia \u0001 , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing\nshort of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less\nthan a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply\nmust streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and\ndisplacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new\nfacilities .\nreducing demand\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .\nthey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail\nmarket would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand\nat lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\nreducing reliance on the spot market\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer\nterm , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands\nof the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .\nopening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their\nprice risk .\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state \u0001 , s institutions\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to\ngreater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to\narrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is\nneeded .\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,\nwhile politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters\nworse . price caps have been proposed . they don \u0001 , t work ; have never worked ;\nand they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how\nineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley\nor silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current\nshortage worse .\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in\ncalifornia . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,\nconstructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in\ncalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power\ngeneration - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads\nand other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the\ncrisis from the media , it \u0001 , s important for you to know this : we at enron will\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real\nsolutions to the state .", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}
