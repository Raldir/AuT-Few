{"text": "ferc ' s prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for ca wholesale. ferc ' s prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for ca wholesale electric markets\nthe following report is comprised of what was discussed at the commission meeting held tonight at approximately 7 pm est and additional intelligence gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting by joe hartsoe :\nphysical withholding - - to prevent physical withholding , the plan will require sellers with pga ' s to offer all their available power in real time . all california generators , even those not subject to ferc price regulation , will be required to sell into the iso ' s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso ' s interstate transmission lines . hydroelectric facilities will be exempted . ( 24 - 7 for lyr )\nprice mitigation - the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market . during stage 1 , 2 and 3 emergencies in the iso ' s real time market , each generator ( other than hydro ) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator ' s heat curve , emission rates , gas costs and emission costs , plus $ 2 for o emissions are to be based on cammon fitzgerald ( ? ) . the gas cost and emissions will be published the day after , for use on the following day . a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators . highest bid sets the clearing price . each gas fired generator must file with ferc and the iso , on a confidential basis , heat and emission rates for each generating unit . the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator , including maintenance and operating costs . in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price , the generator must , within 7 days of the end of each month , file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price . ferc has 60 days to review / act . no opportunity costs in real time . marketers are in the same boat , as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost . however , credit sleeves are permissible .\ndemand response - beginning june 1 , only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids . ferc is attempting to break the demand curve . ( 24 - 7 )\noutages - - pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the commission staff proposal adopted by ferc .\nterm - order expires one year from date of issuance .\nrto filing - california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june 1 or order lapses with no further effect .\niso reporting - on september 14 , 2001 , iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built . comments are due in 15 days . quarterly reports thereafter .\nrevocation of market based rate authority and refunds - the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1 ) no physical withhold of capacity , and 2 ) no inappropriate bidding behavior . inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior . an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate . in addition , \" hockey stick \" bids are expressly prohibited ( i . e . bidding 95 % at marginal cost and 5 % at a much higher level ) .\nlimited 206 filing - applies to sales in the wscc , outside california . refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7 % . control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs . apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified . all marketers and non - hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity / energy to a location within wscc . ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california . comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations . the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the order .\nnox limits in california - - must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law . however , it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement - just include the fines as part of the price bid . also if nox is limited , may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price .\nsurcharge to pay past amount due - - comments are due in 30 days on 1 ) whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and 2 ) the effect this surcharge would have on the pg & e bankruptcy filing .\nno mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from california . the order is not finally drafted as of yet , and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the final order . we will keep you posted .\nra", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}

{"text": "preface for book. preface for book vince ,\n?\nhope you are well .\n?\nwe spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and\nyou kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we\nrealise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote\nsomething , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the\npreface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .\n?\nthanks ,\njulie\n( we ' re getting close )\n?\n?\npreface\n?\n?\n?\none of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk\nmanagement has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for\nthe pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss\nin - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this\nway we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide\nrange of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses\na consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this\nlast point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and\npresentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving\narbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent\nmodels for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose\nconsistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one\nparticular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we\nbelieve that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably\nbe clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and\ngive as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all\nthe models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models\nwhich best suit their needs .\n?\nin order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in\nchapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model\nand price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?\nin addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes\nmodelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees\nand monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout\nthe book .\n?\nin chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as\nanalysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that\ncan be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of\ngeometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility\nand jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated\nand their parameters estimated .\n?\nchapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of\nenron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?\nthis chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,\nmerits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different\npricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and\nelectricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative\naspects of calculating volatility .\n?\nchapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such\ncurves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial\nmarkets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well\ndefined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy\nprices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we\noutline the three main approaches which have been applied to building\nforward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric\napproach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic\nfactors .\n?\nchapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative\nmarkets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this\nchapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as\nenergy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback\noptions , and ladder options .\n?\nchapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot\nprice and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form\nsolutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option\nprices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the\nmodels in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience\nyield and interest rate model .\n?\nchapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options\ncan be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are\ndeveloped for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a\nvariety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which\nincorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is\ndeveloped . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward\ncurve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and\namerican style options .\n?\nchapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on\nmodelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach\nresults in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the\nevolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined\nvolatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form\nsolutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient\nmonte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter\ncloses with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .\n?\nchapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?\nin this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions\nthat trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the\nproblem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a\nportfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging \u0001 )\nillustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the\ngeneral model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor\nhedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .\n?\nchapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )\napplied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after\ndiscussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs\n( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then\ncompare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,\nhistorical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same\nportfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the\nvar estimates for various underlying energy market variables .\n?\nfinally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we\nlook in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan\n( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which\ndetailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an\nextensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present\nnumerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .\n?\nbefore we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this\nbook are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of\nhow both the \u0001 + tool \u0001 , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are\ncertainly not \u0001 & magic wands \u0001 8 which can be waved at data and risk management\nproblems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the\nriskmetrics technical document \u0001 & \u0001 ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will\nreplace experience and professional judgement in managing risk . \u0001 8 . ? however ,\nthe right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}

{"text": "travel services. travel services while recent events have dramatically impacted enron ' s travel volume ,\nalliance worldwide ( formerly travel agency in the park ) wanted to contact\nyou regarding the enron travel program . since 1984 , our company has been a\nstrategic business partner with enron and has provided a complete scope of\nservices from booking , ticketing , ticket delivery , customer service ,\nreporting , management of clicktrip , to facilitating preferred vendor\narrangements with airlines to benefit enron . these services have been\nprovided on a management fee basis from alliance to enron . as of december\n1 , 2001 the management fee has been suspended during enron ' s period of\nreorganization . we are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to\nenron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing\nfee per ticket .\nto provide you with a brief history of our arrangement , enron and alliance\napproached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront\ndiscounts for enron ' s business travel . these discounts are available only\nthrough alliance and are given at time of ticketing . all commissions were\nstripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to enron , in\nexchange for enron paying alliance a contracted management fee . this\nmanagement fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each enron cost center\nbased on the total number of transactions . this travel program provided\nenron over $ 8 . 6 million in airline savings on $ 55 million spent in the year\n2000 and over $ 5 . 2 million on $ 33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of\n2001 . these savings are after the payment of the travel agency management\nfee .\nthe effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by\nthe airlines cannot yet be determined . we have contacted the airline\ncompanies and most of enron ' s preferred carriers have agreed to extend the\ncontracts through april 2002 . you may utilize these discounts through\nalliance by calling 713 650 - 8080 or 1 800 962 - 0248 . in march , enron and\nalliance will begin evaluating enron ' s volume and travel patterns , and\ndetermine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure .\nas mentioned earlier , alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in\nlieu of a management fee . these fees are reimbursable to enron employees\nthrough normal expense report procedures . specifically , the new fee\nstructure is based on zero - commission contracts for tickets purchased from\nenron ' s preferred carriers . the fee schedule for all airline tickets for\nenron travel is as follows :\n$ 30 - domestic tickets with or without upfront discount\n$ 30 - international tickets without upfront discount\n25 % of savings , capped at $ 175 - international tickets with upfront discount\n$ 15 - southwest airlines and clicktrip reservations , hotel / car only bookings\nthe savings to enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees\nthat are charged . for example , enron ' s average ticket prices are $ 589\ndomestic and $ 2207 international ( after discounts ) . enron ' s average savings\nare $ 144 domestic and $ 587 international ( before fees ) . the savings are\nmore than three times the per ticket fee !\nif you are accustomed to booking your own travel online , you may continue to\ndo so by booking through clicktrip . clicktrip is the only online booking\ntool that allows access to enron ' s negotiated discounts . ticketing through\nclicktrip also bears a smaller fee of $ 15 if no agent assistance is\nnecessary . there is no charge to look at schedules . clicktrip is\navailable 24 hours a day and may be accessed through enron ' s intranet site\nor via the internet site\n. clicktrip is also a useful tool for\nchecking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status . to check upgrade\nstatus or to review a ticketed itinerary , simply click the check my trip\nbutton on the clicktrip home page and fill in your name and amadeus locator\nnumber ( provided at the top of your itinerary ) . a user log -
