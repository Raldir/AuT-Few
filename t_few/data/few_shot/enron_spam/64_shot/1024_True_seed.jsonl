{"text": "ferc ' s prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for ca wholesale. ferc ' s prospective mitigation and monitoring plan for ca wholesale electric markets\nthe following report is comprised of what was discussed at the commission meeting held tonight at approximately 7 pm est and additional intelligence gathered from ferc staffers after the meeting by joe hartsoe :\nphysical withholding - - to prevent physical withholding , the plan will require sellers with pga ' s to offer all their available power in real time . all california generators , even those not subject to ferc price regulation , will be required to sell into the iso ' s real time market as a condition of their use of the iso ' s interstate transmission lines . hydroelectric facilities will be exempted . ( 24 - 7 for lyr )\nprice mitigation - the plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market . during stage 1 , 2 and 3 emergencies in the iso ' s real time market , each generator ( other than hydro ) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator ' s heat curve , emission rates , gas costs and emission costs , plus $ 2 for o emissions are to be based on cammon fitzgerald ( ? ) . the gas cost and emissions will be published the day after , for use on the following day . a single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators . highest bid sets the clearing price . each gas fired generator must file with ferc and the iso , on a confidential basis , heat and emission rates for each generating unit . the iso will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator , including maintenance and operating costs . in the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price , the generator must , within 7 days of the end of each month , file a report with ferc and the iso justifying its price . ferc has 60 days to review / act . no opportunity costs in real time . marketers are in the same boat , as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost . however , credit sleeves are permissible .\ndemand response - beginning june 1 , only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids . ferc is attempting to break the demand curve . ( 24 - 7 )\noutages - - pga generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the commission staff proposal adopted by ferc .\nterm - order expires one year from date of issuance .\nrto filing - california iso and two utilities must make rto filing by june 1 or order lapses with no further effect .\niso reporting - on september 14 , 2001 , iso must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built . comments are due in 15 days . quarterly reports thereafter .\nrevocation of market based rate authority and refunds - the market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1 ) no physical withhold of capacity , and 2 ) no inappropriate bidding behavior . inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior . an increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate . in addition , \" hockey stick \" bids are expressly prohibited ( i . e . bidding 95 % at marginal cost and 5 % at a much higher level ) .\nlimited 206 filing - applies to sales in the wscc , outside california . refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7 % . control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs . apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified . all marketers and non - hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity / energy to a location within wscc . ferc is attempting to mirror the rules applied in california . comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations . the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the order .\nnox limits in california - - must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law . however , it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement - just include the fines as part of the price bid . also if nox is limited , may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price .\nsurcharge to pay past amount due - - comments are due in 30 days on 1 ) whether ferc should require the iso to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and 2 ) the effect this surcharge would have on the pg & e bankruptcy filing .\nno mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from california . the order is not finally drafted as of yet , and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the final order . we will keep you posted .\nra", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}

{"text": "preface for book. preface for book vince ,\n?\nhope you are well .\n?\nwe spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and\nyou kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we\nrealise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote\nsomething , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the\npreface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .\n?\nthanks ,\njulie\n( we ' re getting close )\n?\n?\npreface\n?\n?\n?\none of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk\nmanagement has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for\nthe pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss\nin - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this\nway we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide\nrange of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses\na consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this\nlast point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and\npresentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving\narbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent\nmodels for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose\nconsistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one\nparticular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we\nbelieve that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably\nbe clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and\ngive as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all\nthe models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models\nwhich best suit their needs .\n?\nin order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in\nchapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model\nand price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?\nin addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes\nmodelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees\nand monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout\nthe book .\n?\nin chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as\nanalysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that\ncan be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of\ngeometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility\nand jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated\nand their parameters estimated .\n?\nchapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of\nenron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?\nthis chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,\nmerits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different\npricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and\nelectricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative\naspects of calculating volatility .\n?\nchapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such\ncurves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial\nmarkets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well\ndefined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy\nprices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we\noutline the three main approaches which have been applied to building\nforward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric\napproach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic\nfactors .\n?\nchapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative\nmarkets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this\nchapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as\nenergy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback\noptions , and ladder options .\n?\nchapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot\nprice and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form\nsolutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option\nprices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the\nmodels in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience\nyield and interest rate model .\n?\nchapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options\ncan be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are\ndeveloped for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a\nvariety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which\nincorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is\ndeveloped . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward\ncurve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and\namerican style options .\n?\nchapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on\nmodelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach\nresults in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the\nevolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined\nvolatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form\nsolutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient\nmonte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter\ncloses with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .\n?\nchapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?\nin this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions\nthat trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the\nproblem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a\nportfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging \u0001 )\nillustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the\ngeneral model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor\nhedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .\n?\nchapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )\napplied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after\ndiscussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs\n( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then\ncompare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,\nhistorical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same\nportfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the\nvar estimates for various underlying energy market variables .\n?\nfinally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we\nlook in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan\n( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which\ndetailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an\nextensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present\nnumerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .\n?\nbefore we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this\nbook are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of\nhow both the \u0001 + tool \u0001 , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are\ncertainly not \u0001 & magic wands \u0001 8 which can be waved at data and risk management\nproblems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the\nriskmetrics technical document \u0001 & \u0001 ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will\nreplace experience and professional judgement in managing risk . \u0001 8 . ? however ,\nthe right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier !", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}

{"text": "travel services. travel services while recent events have dramatically impacted enron ' s travel volume ,\nalliance worldwide ( formerly travel agency in the park ) wanted to contact\nyou regarding the enron travel program . since 1984 , our company has been a\nstrategic business partner with enron and has provided a complete scope of\nservices from booking , ticketing , ticket delivery , customer service ,\nreporting , management of clicktrip , to facilitating preferred vendor\narrangements with airlines to benefit enron . these services have been\nprovided on a management fee basis from alliance to enron . as of december\n1 , 2001 the management fee has been suspended during enron ' s period of\nreorganization . we are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to\nenron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing\nfee per ticket .\nto provide you with a brief history of our arrangement , enron and alliance\napproached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront\ndiscounts for enron ' s business travel . these discounts are available only\nthrough alliance and are given at time of ticketing . all commissions were\nstripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to enron , in\nexchange for enron paying alliance a contracted management fee . this\nmanagement fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each enron cost center\nbased on the total number of transactions . this travel program provided\nenron over $ 8 . 6 million in airline savings on $ 55 million spent in the year\n2000 and over $ 5 . 2 million on $ 33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of\n2001 . these savings are after the payment of the travel agency management\nfee .\nthe effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by\nthe airlines cannot yet be determined . we have contacted the airline\ncompanies and most of enron ' s preferred carriers have agreed to extend the\ncontracts through april 2002 . you may utilize these discounts through\nalliance by calling 713 650 - 8080 or 1 800 962 - 0248 . in march , enron and\nalliance will begin evaluating enron ' s volume and travel patterns , and\ndetermine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure .\nas mentioned earlier , alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in\nlieu of a management fee . these fees are reimbursable to enron employees\nthrough normal expense report procedures . specifically , the new fee\nstructure is based on zero - commission contracts for tickets purchased from\nenron ' s preferred carriers . the fee schedule for all airline tickets for\nenron travel is as follows :\n$ 30 - domestic tickets with or without upfront discount\n$ 30 - international tickets without upfront discount\n25 % of savings , capped at $ 175 - international tickets with upfront discount\n$ 15 - southwest airlines and clicktrip reservations , hotel / car only bookings\nthe savings to enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees\nthat are charged . for example , enron ' s average ticket prices are $ 589\ndomestic and $ 2207 international ( after discounts ) . enron ' s average savings\nare $ 144 domestic and $ 587 international ( before fees ) . the savings are\nmore than three times the per ticket fee !\nif you are accustomed to booking your own travel online , you may continue to\ndo so by booking through clicktrip . clicktrip is the only online booking\ntool that allows access to enron ' s negotiated discounts . ticketing through\nclicktrip also bears a smaller fee of $ 15 if no agent assistance is\nnecessary . there is no charge to look at schedules . clicktrip is\navailable 24 hours a day and may be accessed through enron ' s intranet site\nor via the internet site\n. clicktrip is also a useful tool for\nchecking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status . to check upgrade\nstatus or to review a ticketed itinerary , simply click the check my trip\nbutton on the clicktrip home page and fill in your name and amadeus locator\nnumber ( provided at the top of your itinerary ) . a user log -

louise kitchen no . 17\nfortune , 10 / 15 / 01\ndrop in natural - gas prices may be good for consumers but hinder new production\nby alexei barrionuevo\nstaff reporter of the wall street journal\n10 / 02 / 2001\nthe wall street journal\nc 7\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )\nin the wake of last month ' s terrorist attacks , natural - gas prices have slid below $ 2 per million british thermal units , frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural - gas projects .\nanalysts predict that with prices at current levels , projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u . s . could be shelved or canceled .\nnatural - gas prices , which reached highs of nearly $ 10 per million btus last december , had held to around $ 3 to $ 5 per million btus for much of the year . at $ 2 per million btus and below , producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production .\nanalysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand , fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric - utility demand . nearby november futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $ 2 . 208 on the new york mercantile exchange .\nin the boston area , however , different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region . last week , the u . s . coast guard , under pressure from local lawmakers , indefinitely banned lng tankers from entering boston harbor . lng makes up 15 % of new england ' s gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days . the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists .\nalready , relative to other areas , natural - gas prices have inched higher in new england , where natural - gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market . the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week by 30 cents to $ 1 . 30 per million btus , said a spokeswoman for distrigas , a unit of belgium ' s tractebel sa . but the lack of lng isn ' t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural - gas storage is used up .\nrichard grant , ceo of distrigas , says lng has a 30 - year safety record at the company ' s everett , mass . , terminal . while lng is flammable , he says it is unlikely to explode . he adds that \" there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual . but until we answer the concerns , we won ' t be able to bring a ship in here . \"\ndeutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . \" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , \" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . \" but all that is out the window now . \" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october .\nwhile prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august .\neven with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence .\nstill , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . \" you will see some cancellations and some delays , \" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston .\nnatural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg .\na spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nenron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank\nfreny patel mumbai\n10 / 02 / 2001\nbusiness standard\n5\ncopyright ( c ) business standard\nafter months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na .\nagainst an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank .\nthe deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot .\nwith property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the\nshort run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets .\nproperty consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income .\nenron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot .\nthis is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company .\nthe deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars .\nindustry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired .\nin order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot .\nfour to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property .\n\" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , \" he added .\nmoreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers\nthough hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business .\nthe complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 .\nin the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april .\nin these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in \" patient but not passive , \" the story that accompanies the list , \" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . \"\nfiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , \" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , \" she says .\nas always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah \" hurricane debby \" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter .\nfourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond -

where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . \" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first .\nin a related story , \" it took a lady to save avon , \" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , \" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . \" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins .\nin addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou -

{"text": "[ ilug ] please kindly get back to me. [ ilug ] please kindly get back to me from : mr . desmond stevens\nurgent assistance .\nyou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . i am mr . desmond stevens , the first son of dr . dennis stevens , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i was furnished with viable information from the world trade centre here in amsterdam , the netherlands and decided to write you .\nbefore the death of my father , he had taken me to amsterdam to deposit the sum of ten million , five hundred thousand united states dollars ( us $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) in a security company , as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe . this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farm in swaziland . this land problem came when zimbabwe president mr . robert mugabe , introduced a new land act that wholly affected rich white farmers and some few black farmers . this resulted to the killing and mob action by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society . infact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act of which my father was one of the victims . it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in amsterdam decided to transfer my father \u0092 s money to\na foreign account . since the law of the netherlands prohibit a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any account or to be involved in any financial transaction .\nas the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . as a businessman , whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , all i need you to do for me is to make arrangement and come to amsterdam , the netherlands so that you can open the non - resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas . this money i intend to use for investment . i have\noptions to offer you , first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction , or you can go into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country . whichever option you choose , feel free to notify me . i have mapped out 5 % of this money for all expenses incurred in processing this transaction . if you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you 25 % of the money while the remaining 70 % that is meant for me , will be for the investment in your country .\nplease , contact me with the above telephone and e - mail address , while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction .\nyours faithfully ,\ndesmond stevens .\n- -\nirish linux users ' group : ilug @ linux . ie\nhttp : / / www . linux . ie / mailman / listinfo / ilug for ( un ) subscription information .\nlist maintainer : listmaster @ linux . ie", "label": 1, "label_text": "spam"}
