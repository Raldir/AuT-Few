{"text": "california energy crisis. california energy crisis california \u0001 , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several\nmonths . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we\nwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .\nplease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation\nand our position on california energy issues .\nwhat happened in california\nthe source of california \u0001 , s current problem is as straightforward as supply\nand demand . california \u0001 , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased\nthe demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory\nrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so\ndemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,\npredictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10\npercent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .\nin addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related\nfactors that led to the current crisis . first , the state \u0001 , s regulations\nforced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for\npower is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market\nwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long\nterm , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in\ncalifornia , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the\nequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the\nmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine\nwhile the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt\nwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .\nsecond , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained\nin effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep\ncompetition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale\nprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the\nregulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .\nin short , california \u0001 , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .\nregulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new\ngeneration from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile\nspot prices .\nat the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned\nthe state \u0001 , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,\nif adopted , would have averted the current crisis .\nenron \u0001 , s role\nmany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix\nthe problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the\npoliticians and the media . here are the facts :\n? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the\nstate of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the\nsame market available to other california purchasers . because we are a\nmarket maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are\ninterested only in having a market that works so that we can package products\nfor our customers .\n? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from\nthe problems the states \u0001 , utilities , and their customers , now face . we\nprotected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .\nyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply\npower directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on\nthe open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a \u0001 enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron\ncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western\npower markets . enron \u0001 , s primary business is managing risk for our customers\nwith solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more\ndemand for our products and services .\nthe solution\nthe solution to california \u0001 , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the\nstate must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market\nand shore up the financial stability of the state \u0001 , s utilities .\nincreasing supply\ncalifornia \u0001 , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing\nshort of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less\nthan a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply\nmust streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations\ngenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the\nregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and\ndisplacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can\nhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new\nfacilities .\nreducing demand\ncustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .\nthey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail\nmarket would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand\nat lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .\nreducing reliance on the spot market\nin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from\nvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer\nterm , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands\nof the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .\nopening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their\nprice risk .\nrestoring the financial integrity of the state \u0001 , s institutions\nthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to\ngreater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to\narrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover\ntheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and\ndistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is\nneeded .\njust as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,\nwhile politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters\nworse . price caps have been proposed . they don \u0001 , t work ; have never worked ;\nand they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,\nwhich then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how\nineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it\nis better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley\nor silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current\nshortage worse .\nthe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in\ncalifornia . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that\nthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,\nconstructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in\ncalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power\ngeneration - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads\nand other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .\nas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the\ncrisis from the media , it \u0001 , s important for you to know this : we at enron will\ncontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real\nsolutions to the state .", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}

' '\nbankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .\nlee tried for for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed .\ninvestors including saudi prince alwaleed bin talal , the\nblackstone group lp and the carlyle group inc . turned them down\nbecause of concern enron wouldn ' t be able to pay its debts . that\nconcern was heightened after enron disclosed a previously\nundisclosed $ 690 million interest payment due this week .\ndynegy said in a statement distributed by business wire that\nit terminated its agreement because enron breached covenants .\nchairman and ceo chuck watson said dynegy would invoke its right\nto purchase enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline . dynegy used an\ninvestment of $ 1 . 5 billion from chevrontexaco corp . , which owns\none quarter of dynegy , to purchase the enron unit , which operates\n16 , 500 miles of natural gas pipeline .\nenron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t return calls for\ncomment .\ntrading doubts\nenron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading\npartners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay\nbills . as a result , they either demanded more collateral to trade\nor restricting trading with the houston - based company .\nenrononline , enron corp . ' s online trading system , stopped\nallowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gas\nlate this morning , say traders who use the web site . enron said\nyesterday that enrononline handles about 60 percent of its trading\nbusiness , or about $ 2 . 8 billion a day in trading on average over\nthe last 30 days .\n` ` we can log in , but there is nothing there , nothing to buy\nand nothing to sell , ' ' said juha laiho , an energy trader at\nfinland - based fortum oyj in houston . ` ` it went down some time\nthis morning . ' '\ns in both 1998\nand 1999 , it had been less than a majority .\nparticipants in the plan , which had $ 2 . 14 billion in assets\navailable for benefits , could only do so much to diversify their\ninvestments . enron , like many other companies , used stock rather\nthan cash to match employee contributions and restricted sales of\nthe shares .\nand they could only guess at the year - end makeup of the plan ' s\nassets until the end of june , reflecting sec disclosure standards\nfor savings plans . by that time , the stock ' s drop - - which reached\n99 percent today - - was already well under way .\ntrio of lawsuits\nenron later reported $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter charges ;\nousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who ran partnerships\nthat accounted for some of the charges ; restated its results since\n1997 ; became the target of an sec accounting investigation ; and\naccepted a takeover bid from dynegy inc . , its biggest rival .\nthe company ' s shares , which ended last year at $ 83 . 13 , fell as\nlow as $ 1 . 05 today before a midday trading halt as enron ' s debt was\ndowngraded to junk - bond status and dynegy abandoned its offer .\nin response to the plunge , employees in the 401 ( k ) plan - -\nwhich allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax - free\nsavings , and takes its name from a section of the internal revenue\nservice code - - have filed three lawsuits against enron .\nthe suits allege , among other things , that the houston - based\ncompany prevented employees from shifting investments within the\nplan between oct . 17 , the day after its disclosure of the charges ,\nand nov . 19 as the company made administrative changes .\nall three seek class - action status on behalf of the plan ' s\nparticipants . the most recent filing came from the gottesdiener law\nfirm , based in washington , on monday . it covers the longest time\nperiod : november 1995 to now .\nfalling percentages\nenron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan ' s\nassets at the end of 1994 , the year before the period associated\nwith the gottesdiner suit began . the figure reflected a one - time\ncompany contribution of preferred stock , and rose from 62 percent\nin 1993 .\neach preferred share has a face value of $ 100 and is\nconvertible into 27 . 304 common shares . this translates into a\nconversion price of $ 3 . 66 a share , which was a bargain before\ntoday ' s trading .\nthe plan also owned a stake in enron ' s former oil and gas\nunit , which became eog resources inc . after gaining independence in\n1999 . add in those shares , and company stock represented about two -\nthirds of the 1994 assets .\nenron ' s common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of\n401 ( k ) assets available for benefits in 1995 , 58 percent in 1996\nand 53 percent in 1997 as the u . s . stock market rallied , lifting\nthe value of participants ' investments in equity mutual funds .\nthe shares represented 49 percent of the plan ' s assets in\n1998 . the proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999 , when the\nassets more than doubled - - exceeding the 56 percent increase in\nenron ' s share price that year - - to $ 1 . 62 billion .\nhow much choice ?\nthen came last year , when the common shares recorded their\nbest performance in more than two decades even as u . s . stocks\nstumbled . enron rallied 87 percent amid soaring electricity and\nnatural gas prices , while the standard & poor ' s 500 index , a market\nbenchmark that includes the company , fell 10 percent .\ncompany shares in the plan rose in value by $ 652 . 7 million ,\naccording to an sec filing . the total includes shares bought and\nsold throughout the year . by contrast , mutual - fund holdings fell by\n$ 47 million and ` ` other investments ' ' rose by just $ 134 , 000 , the\nfiling said .\nat year - end , the 401 ( k ) plan owned 13 . 9 million enron common\nshares and 70 , 000 preferred shares , valued at $ 1 . 32 billion . this\ntotal encompasses not only enron ' s matching contributions to the\nplan , but also employees ' investments with their own money .\nthe company generally provides a 50 percent match , in stock ,\nfor the first 6 percent of pay that goes into the plan . employees\ncan ' t sell the shares and move the proceeds into other investment\nchoices until they reach the age of 50 .\ncompany contributions accounted for about 11 percent of the\nplan ' s stock holdings , said karen denne , an enron spokeswoman . the\nfigure suggests employees invested more heavily in their company\nthan usual for 401 ( k ) participants .\nwaiting for data\nfor the average u . s . plan account , company stock amounted to\n19 percent of assets at the end of last year , according to a study\ndone by the employee benefit research institute and the investment\ncompany institute and published last week .\nin any case , enron ' s approach to matching ensures that as much\nas one - third of the contribution to an employee ' s account takes the\nform of shares that they can ' t sell right away .\nanyone who wanted to gauge how this approach , and enron ' s\nstock performance , affected the plan ' s financial position last year\nhad to wait until june 27 . that ' s when the filing cited earlier\narrived at the sec .\nemployee savings and stock - purchase plans , such as 401 ( k )\nplans , don ' t have to submit annual reports until 180 days after\ntheir fiscal year ends . they can even get a 15 - day extension of the\ndeadline if they need one .\nby the time enron ' s plan made its annual report , it was\nalready a bit too late to act on the information . the company ' s\nshares dropped 44 percent between the end of 2000 and the date of\nthe submission . as the filing demonstrated , employees looking to\nsave for retirement had been set up for a fall .\nenron ' s credit rating cut to junk by s & p and moody ' s ( update 4 )\n2001 -

{"text": "competitive analysis update # 24 - us response to terrorism. competitive analysis update # 24 - us response to terrorism updates below on afghanistan campaign , key issues for energy / financial markets in \" phase two \" of campaign , federal reserve activity , and nuclear plant security .\nrj\nspecial forces / low intensity campaign underway\nsources agree that the u . s . military operation in afghanistan has begun . indications of special forces activity were strongly signaled when taliban forces shot down a u . s . unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ) on monday . the uav that was shot down , a predator , has a range of less than 400 miles , suggesting that u . s . special forces are closing in on afghanistan .\nspecial forces units are concentrating on intelligence gathering and targeting key bin ladin installations , as well as attempting to locate bin ladin himself . as defense secretary donald rumsfeld noted yesterday , \" there will not be a d - day as such . \" the afghanistan campaign at least initially will not be like desert storm , where cnn cameras in baghdad hotels offered real - time imagery of u . s . air strikes . the first phases of this war are being fought largely in secret , punctuated intermittently by what little coverage the media can provide . the action in phase one includes night raids , a lot of small - scale special operations reconnaissance and , when necessary , direct contact raids . a large military strike using airpower is also forthcoming , but is unlikely to be reported in real - time .\noperational security is tight\ndefense secretary donald rumsfeld said u . s . military officials will refuse to comment on anything that will endanger troops or operations . \" and anyone that does talk to any of you about that is breaking federal criminal law and should be in jail , \" rumsfeld said . when asked if he would lie to the press to disguise u . s . military operations , rumsfeld said \" you never say never . \"\nnext phases of u . s . campaign more important to markets\nif us military action is limited to afghanistan , any immediate spike in oil prices is unlikely to endure because such a limited attack will not directly impact oil supply . however , us officials have said that the war on terrorism will go far beyond afghanistan , so markets will continue to exhibit some degree of uncertainty until further developments take place .\nin the short term , oil supplies would be most directly affected by strikes against iraq . but any spike might be short lived as opec has enough spare capacity to cover an iraqi outage . in the medium term , oil markets might express fears over regional stability in the middle east and persian gulf regions as a result of us military strikes and possible subsequent terrorist attacks .\nit is expected that iraqi biological - chemical weaponry will receive considerable attention in the days ahead and as has been widely reported , there is a split in the bush administration over whether to include iraq . the iraqi weapons of mass destruction capability is likely to once again complicate the rollover of the un oil - for - food program in december , which could lead to the iraqis removing their oil from the market independently of what is happening in afghanistan . another key issue is whether the expected refugee crisis and rising islamic radicalism will destabilize the nuclear - armed pakistani government .\nsaudis showing increased cooperation in oil policy and in military planning\nafter a brief furor when the saudi government announced that the u . s . would not be able to expand its operations at the prince sultan airbase near riyahd , us - saudi cooperation has improved . the public announcement of the airbase prohibition had been a pr move by the saudis to head off domestic accusations of handing blank checks to the usa . centcom has subsequently transferred its ops command to saudi arabia . in addition , the saudis have responded to u . s . pressure by officially severing relations with the taliban .\nin vienna , all indications are that the saudis are working toward an opec agreement to keep the market well supplied with oil and to not take advantage of the political uncertainty affecting the crude markets by cutting production . the most likely outcome is that opec will officially hold production at current levels , but agree to limited cheating to ensure adequate supply . another possibility is that opec will lower the target range for the opec basket price that would take lower demand forecasts into account . either step would allow opec to preserve cohesion at a time of political and economic uncertainty . if prices continue a rapid decline after the vienna meeting , washington and riyadh might come up with a \" politically correct \" way to \" spin \" an output reduction by blaming market volatility on speculators rather than on opec . the cartel is likely to reconvene in early november to reassess market conditions .\nfed shifts its model to adapt to new economic reality\nthe fed is still struggling to answers for what recent events will do to the economy but it ' s clear that three elements of their model have fundamentally changed :\n1 . the most important is a significant drop in all aspects of individuals ' and companies ' risk tolerance , which must be reversed quickly . the fed has done its bit by stabilizing the financial system and congress is stepping in with a total stimulus package of $ 100 - 150 billion ( greenspan supports $ 100\nbln ) . on the diplomatic / military side , the balanced , multilateral approach of the administration together with discreet pressure on opec to reduce prices is all designed to stabilize expectations and boost sentiment .\n2 . on rates , while the fed is expected to keep cutting ( they won ' t disappoint the market ) , sources report that greenspan is actually quite comfortable using liquidity to alter actual fed funds rather than changing official rates . however , the fed governors are increasingly convinced that sentiment really depends on military success and they are even more aware than that they are running out of ammunition on the rate cutting side .\n3 . despite greenspan ' s protests we are looking at a fiscal boost that will push the budget to at least a 1 % of gdp deficit .\nnuclear plants under increased security scrutiny\nthe washington - based nuclear control institute and the los angeles - based committee to bridge the gap urged the government to immediately station 30 to 40 national guard troops around nuclear plants to protect them from attacks . the watchdog groups also said the government should be prepared to deploy anti - aircraft weapons to shoot down attack planes . another needed measure is to carefully re - check the background of all nuclear plant employees and contractors to prevent internal sabotage .", "label": 0, "label_text": "ham"}
